                        <p class="crew-details">Born and raised in the DC Universe, Nariman grew up on good food, good
                            beer, and an unhealthy obsession with cheesy 80’s horror movies.<br><br>
                            Graduating from a life of gigging bands and ill-prepared steak, Nariman studied sound
                            engineering and audio production at the Digital Academy in 2004, and started off his career
                            as a sound engineer in Mumbai. Within a year, he moved on to music composition and
                            programming, moonlighting as a session guitarist.<br><br>
                            In 2013, Nariman packed his bags for London and studied Music Production with Ableton at
                            Point Blank Music School. Soon after his return, he teamed up with ex-bandmate Rahul Pais as
                            a composer-producer duo, and in months, their lovechild The Jamroom was born.<br><br>
                            Three Jamroom-filled years on, Nariman shifted base to set up their new outpost in Singapore
                            and expand the company in the global market.<br><br>
                            He currently heads operations in Singapore as composer and producer.<br><br>
                            When he’s not working, immersed in graphic novels, trying new whiskies, or playing the
                            PlayStation, Nariman can be found waiting on his dog, Bacon. His plans for the future
                            include mastering the ability to cook the world’s greatest steak.</p>

                        <p class="crew-details">Rahul grew up in a household where music was religion. With music across
                            genres and generations emanating from every room - very often at the same time - perhaps his
                            love for creating new sounds began in the corridor outside.<br><br>
                            From an early age, he was fascinated by film and moved by the music he heard in scores. He
                            started his journey in music dabbling in singing and playing classical piano and eventually
                            moving on to playing the guitar and the bass. Even before Rahul could legally enter a bar,
                            Pais (and his bass) began gigging in them, playing for various bands and collectives across
                            the city.<br><br>
                            In 2012, after a couple of years experimenting with electronic music, his love for film and
                            music collided when he was asked to help produce the music for a short film. Shortly after,
                            he and ex-bandmate, Nariman Khambata, founded The Jamroom.<br><br>
                            Rahul is passionate about every aspect of the music production and songwriting process. He
                            strives to give every project a unique musical voice.</p>

                        <p class="crew-details">From church choirgirl to Trinity School of Music electronic keyboardist,
                            Manju ‘Mama Thug’ Moses resisted the idea of a traditional desk job and grew up envisioning
                            life in the advertising world in Mumbai. After completing her Bachelor’s degree in Mass
                            Media, she started her career as an agency producer with Leo Burnett India, followed by a
                            stint at Grey Worldwide.<br><br>
                            Switching disciplines, Manju began working with production houses where she got first-hand
                            experience in producing some of her favourite campaigns. In 2018, she donned her Mama Thug
                            hat and joined The Jamroom to keep the ‘family in line’.<br><br>
                            When she’s not busy getting her way, Manju loves to travel. If she’s not in the studio,
                            chances are, you’ll find her hiking in the mountains.</p>

                            child, Yash gave it all up for a song and a dream.<br><br>
                            He started his career in music as a sound engineer, and after a brief stint as a studio
                            assistant, he found his true calling in composing. After months of gruelling lessons in
                            music arrangement, Yash joined The Jamroom as a programmer and composer.<br><br>
                            He celebrates his new-found status in life by refusing to eat carbs and picking fights with
                            people who don’t understand complex time signatures.<br><br>
                            Nicknamed ‘Pudding’ because of his quiet jiggly nature and ability to take on the flavour of

                            and scheming-to-take-over-the-world demeanour.<br><br>
                            On most days, Bacon can be found plotting attacks on unsuspecting dry leaves at The Jamroom
